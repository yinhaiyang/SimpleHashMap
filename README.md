# Simple HashMap

A Flutter application illustrating a small part of basic data structure of HashMap

## TODO

Due to the limited time and lack of experience, there are still many work to do:
- **A better hash function** —— now is the `.hashcode` function provided by the dart language
- **Change <String,String> to generic <K,V>**
- **[Bug] Scroll a long list cause `NullPointerError`**
- **Better Flutter and dart code organization**
- **Completely Code review** —— almost every function is just roughly implemented
- too many...

## Special thanks

I want to deeply thank you for this task and the interview. In the past my most programming experiences are about application level. It's almost the first time to solving such a basic programming problem. It's a little difficult but much more interest. I've learned a lot from it and realized my weakness. I believe it has opens a new door for me to go further.
